## About

We document ongoing work-in-progress updates, decisions, and lessons learned so results are easy to track over time and simple for new researchers to pick up.

Each project page links to relevant code, datasets, experiment artifacts, and meeting logs to promote reproducibility and smooth handovers.

By standardizing how we record progress and challenges, the site helps the lab collaborate more effectively and share transferable research practices.
